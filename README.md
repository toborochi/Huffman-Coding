#### What can this program do?
You can compress text files basically.
#### Can compress other kinds of files?
Try it! Technically you can load any type of file, but the compression will not necessarily work well.( In fact you can apply the same principle to compress images).
#### How fast does it compress?
Well, I did not do an analysis on this. But, more or less I did some tests with 1MB file (compressed in ~3 seconds), 10 MB file (compressed in ~22 seconds).
